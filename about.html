                <h2>My journey</h2>
                <p>
                I worked in government for almost 16 years before becoming a developer. <br><br>
                My background is mostly in an emergency services environment specialising in business process improvement, policy development and communications. <br><br>
                In early 2022 I decided it was time for a career change and hired a career consultant to help me on my journey. <br><br>
                After some research and self-analysis I applied for the <a href="https://shecodes.com.au/" target="_blank">She Codes Plus program</a>, which I completed in May of 2023. <br><br>
                From there I began applying for jobs as a developer and started delving more into game development as a hobby. <br><br>
                This included attending workshops hosted by <a href="https://levelherup.com.au/" target="_blank">Level Her Up</a> to learn more about the different aspects of game development. <br><br>
                I'm continuing online studies so you'll see projects added to my portfolio as I build my skills. <br><br>
                If you'd like to know more check out my GitHub, LinkedIn profile or contact me using the form. <br><br>
